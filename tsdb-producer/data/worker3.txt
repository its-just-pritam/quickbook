The first thing I saw when I died— was the light.

I know. I know.

Cliché. But, not that kind of light.

People.

They glowed—bright, colorful auras pulsing like slow heartbeats. The air even shimmered around them.

It was pretty freaking amazing.

I’d just died, had zero clue how, and instead of freaking out, I was mesmerized. Since I couldn’t see my own color, I figured I’d make it a game — every time I saw someone else’s color, I’d ask what it meant. Afterlife baseball cards.

A guy walked by glowing pale blue.

I caught his arm. “Hey, why so blue?” I joked.

He smirked. “Drowning. Peaceful too, once you stop fighting it.” He patted my shoulder and kept walking.

A woman glowing ember-red caught my eye. I stepped confidently in front of her.

“Let me guess! Red—died by fire?”

She laughed. “Close. Car crash. Red means unfinished business, sweetie. Good guess, though.” She dazzled off in spackling light.

“Excuse me, young man.”

I turned around. There stood this tiny lady. Golden, like she had stars inside her. I blinked.

She smiled and pinched my cheek.

“Before you ask—old age. A good color for a good ending, wouldn’t you agree?”

Bathed in her glow, I smiled and nodded.

“And what’s your story, sweetie?” she asked.
