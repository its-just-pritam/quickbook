I knew something was up when my wife started smiling again.

She’s been happier than I’ve seen her in years, and I’ll admit that my first thought was that she was having an affair.

I wanted to confront her about it, but “you’ve been smiling too much” isn’t exactly evidence.

But then she started coming home with dirt under her fingernails, and I knew I had to speak up. Something funny was going on, and I was going to get to the bottom of it.

I told my wife, “If there’s anything you wanna tell me, now's the time, because if I find out on my own then I’m gonna be very upset.”

She admitted everything.

“You’ve been doing what?” I asked.

“Burying myself alive,” she smiled, “it’s been life-changing.” 

For thirty minutes at a time, once a week, every week for the past three months, my wife has been buried alive in a coffin.

“First the adrenaline kicks in and you panic,” she explained, “but afterwards you feel completely at peace. All your problems seem so small once you’ve stared death in the face. You’ve got to try it!”

After a small back-and-forth, my wife somehow convinced me to try her little “therapy.” I mostly agreed because I wanted to catch her in a lie. When I came out of the ground and didn’t feel any better, I’d make her confess the real reason she’s been so happy lately.

At a quarter past seven I entered the coffin.

“Give me your phone,” my wife demanded.

“Why,” I asked, “it’s gonna be dark down there.”
