The flowers were nice. I wish I knew their names. I didn’t want to focus on the funeral. I wish I could be anywhere else. I look around the room and see people my mother’s age. Most of them are teary eyed. I know after the service they’re all going to be looking for me and they’re all going to be asking the same questions.

"Did she show any signs?"

and I’ll say

"She was depressed for a long time, probably why she never reached out for help."

They'll nod like they understand.

Then ask.

"Where’s Stephanie?"

Then I'll have to make a choice. Do I keep up the lie? Do I repeat the words that I’ve been assigned to say when anyone asks about her?

"She's at an overseas school and she wasn't able to get a flight out."

Will that work? Will they buy that?

They’ll probably think it’s weird, but we’re at my mother’s funeral. They’ll let it go.

On the other hand I could tell them the truth.

"Mom killed Stephanie last year."

They’ll be shocked silent.

I’ll nod like it’s normal.

"Yep, smothered her in her sleep. Remember when we made that patio? That’s why we made it. I’m basically an accomplice."

They’ll want to know more.

"What happened? Did you call the police?"

"Nope," I’ll say. "She would have killed me too." The song sung by every accomplice since murder began.

But it would be the truth.

Then those teary eyes will dry up.

And suddenly we’ll be monsters. Branded.

I’ll go to prison. I’m the only one alive to punish.

The public will want its pound of flesh.

They deserve it too.

I should have called the police.
